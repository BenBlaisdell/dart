This is a proof of concept of using nginx.
========================================

* Prereqs:
-- Please note the use of disabling selinux (overriding /etc/selinux/config and calling sudo setenforce 0)
-- The server_name testing is done via the host machine (the mac).
   -- we add these two lines to /etc/hosts (use sudo vi /etc/hosts in the host machine [the mac])
     127.0.0.1  example.com  www.example.com a.example.com b.example.com c.example.com
     127.0.0.1  test.com www.test.com a.test.com b.test.com

* The above lines allow us to access the guest (vbox) machine.  
-- We mapped the host port 8080 to the guests 80 (see the Vagrantfile)
-- E.g. www.example.com:8080 should get the hello example page. (Enter in browser of the host machine)
        c.example.com:8080 should get the generic nginx page since example.conf server_name has only example.com and www.example.com
        (See local nginx/example.conf)

* The proof: (That adding new address names to the server_name lines actually catches them)
-- Add c.example.com in the VM guest at /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.conf (in the server_name line)
-- run sudo nginx -s reload
-- hit c.example.com:8080 in the host nachine and you shall see that we now get the hello example page and not the generic nginx page.
